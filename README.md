# Convolutional-Cell

An experiment to implement a RNN-unit (Cell), which will help combine the benefits of both RNNs and CNNs.

The benefit of using a RNN is that it allows for time varying information, example text or audio.
Whereas the benefit of using CNN is that you can legitimately make stronge assumptions i.e. you can obtain stronger results. CNNs make the assumptions locally and hence are more powerful. This depends on the data that infact exhibits locality (auto-corelation) like images or time series.
